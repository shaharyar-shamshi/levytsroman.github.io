        I am Shaharyar Shamshi a Programmer and self proclaimed political critics or better to 
        say Anti National according to definition of the Indian media who love to solve the
        problem applying computer science Skill. I am always eager to work on
        challenging task which will help me to learn new technology. I had a
        first intercation with computer science during my undergraduation and
        believe me it was not love at first sight but eventually I fall for it
        and now with time there is many fold increase in this love. If you want
